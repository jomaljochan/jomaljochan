<!-- # [Life in Warsaw]{.underline} -->

<!-- I was born and raised in the capital of Poland, Warsaw. Living in this great and vibrant city for so many years was an amazing experience, and I invite everyone to come to see it for yourself! -->

<!-- # [Bachelor's degree at Warsaw School of Economics]{.underline} -->

<!-- I enjoyed going to the primary, secondary and high school, as I met a lot of interesting people that got me inspired on everyday basis. Eventually, I decided to stay in Warsaw to pursue Bachelor's diploma in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems at [Warsaw School of Economics](https://www.sgh.waw.pl/en). -->

<!-- *(Picture of me sailing in the Mazurian Lakes region in Poland)* -->

<!-- Moreover, the school gave me an opportunity to participate in foreign exchange programme at [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/), where I have spent one incredible semester! -->

<!-- # [Professional life and the future...]{.underline} -->

<!-- After my first year of studies, I got into **PwC** as part of the WEX program, where I spent -->
<!-- a month in the business consulting department, where I had my first contact -->
<!-- with consultant work, in which I liked the way of approaching difficult -->
<!-- problems. -->

<!-- And it all made me decide to get into the research department at **McKinsey**, where I have supported -->
<!-- 30+ different projects and developed insights into the energy and TMT sectors -->
<!-- in Poland. This has convinced me to do an internship as a junior business -->
<!-- analyst at **Kearney**, during which I have worked on a cost optimization project -->
<!-- for a leading Romanian telco. -->

<!-- In future I would see myself working as a data-analytics consultant in a strategic advisory company, however, I am open to all opportunities... -->
