<div id="professional-goals" class="section level2">
<h2>Professional goals</h2>
<p>Being an engineer who chose to follow a career centered around analytics &amp; leadership, the roles I took up reflected my passion for data and effective decision making driven by data. During my 2 yearâ€™s of work experience, I worked for a growing B2B e-commerce start-up(Udaan.com) as a Financial Planning &amp; Analysis Intern and an Indian Private Bank(RBL Bank) as Manager-Analytics.</p>
<p>As my career progressed, I was entrusted with more autonomy over my projects &amp; the opportunity to lead and mentor my juniors. This experience is what motivated me to join the <strong>Masters in Analytics &amp; Management Program</strong> at <strong>London Business School</strong>; to be able to lead innovation in data-focused decision making and help firms push forward towards a data- driven society we all will live in in the near future.</p>

<h2>Udaan.com</h2>
<p>My first 6 month internship at <strong>Udaan.com</strong>, a growing B2B start-up which was also the fastest unicorn start-up as a <strong>Financial Planning &amp; Analysis Intern</strong> in India was extremely formative as it was the first time I was exposed to Analytics(SQL &amp; R) for business intelligence &amp; financial planning.</p>
<p>As I had no prior experience in analytics, the learning curve was quite steep. Nevertheless, I rose to the opportunity &amp; picked up the skills required for the fast paced environment &amp; began planning the budgets &amp; target planning for one of the largest departments at the firm. This also helped me get selected for projects involving multiple departments requiring high levels of collaboration. These projects</p>

<div id="rbl-bank" class="section level2">
<h2>RBL Bank</h2>
<p>Post my stint at Udaan.com, I shifted to a growing private bank in India: <strong>RBL Bank</strong> as <strong>Manager-Analytics</strong>. With the fairly non-hierarchical leadership team at RBL bank, I was able to prove my ability as a leader as well as an analytics professional. Leading multiple projects involving financial modelling and prediction algorithms, I was able to polish my technical know-how along with tackling the problems of cross-functional team management, project management etc.</p>
<p>This led me to the Masters in Analytics &amp; Management Program at London Business School and I wish to take my experience further by working in Venture Architecture, building businesses from scratch driven my data.</p>
