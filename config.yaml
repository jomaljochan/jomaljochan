    subtitle: "From my first internship at Udaan.com, a growing B2B e-comerce firm in
    India, I have been in love with Analytics. \n Post my move to RBL Bank, a growing
    private sector bank, I have enjoyed using analytics to drive decision making in
    the micro-finance banking sector. \n From the drive to do more and gain an
    international view of the work I do, I have taken up the Masters in Analytics &
    Management degree at London Business School. \n Through the testing courses and
    a cohort of brilliant peers, I wish to venture into the world of Venture Architecture;
    helping firms build businesses from scratch. \n I hope you are part of my journey too!"
